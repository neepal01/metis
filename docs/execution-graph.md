# Execution Graph

Metis executes the graph under `metis_engine.execution` in the selected YAML
file. The packaged graph runs `initialize`, `review`, and `triage`. Installed
packages may add more stages and nodes. A project-provided execution section
replaces that graph as a whole. Every node listed in the selected graph
executes; an omitted node is not part of that graph.

Read [Terminology](#terminology), [Default graph](#default-graph), and
[Stage contracts](#stage-contracts) to configure a run. Contributors adding a
built-in component should use
[Adding built-in execution nodes and stages](contributing/adding-execution-component.md);
separately distributed components start at
[Adding external nodes and stages](#adding-external-nodes-and-stages).

## Terminology

- **Execution graph**: the complete configured workflow
- **Stage**: a workflow boundary such as `initialize`, `review`, `triage`, or
  an installed external stage
- **Node**: executable work inside a stage, such as `codegraph`,
  `simple_llm_review`, `reachability`, `finding_dedup`, `triage`, or `result`
- **Execution Node API**: the public Python contracts used to implement and
  register Nodes; its exported types are not YAML-selectable Nodes
- **CodeGraph**: the language-neutral representation of code symbols, calls,
  source locations, and language-derived facts
- **CodeGraph provider**: a language-owned implementation that builds a
  validated `CodeGraph`
- **Capability**: an engine service a node may use when its YAML allowlist
  grants access, such as `index`, `memory`, or `navigation`
- **Tool**: a model-callable operation that a node deliberately creates from a
  granted capability; a capability grant does not expose tools automatically
- **Data dependency**: an input bound to another node's output
- **Control dependency**: ordering declared with `depends_on` when no value is
  transferred

YAML names product behavior. It does not contain Python implementation paths or
`uses` fields.

## Default graph

```yaml
metis_engine:
  execution:
    inputs:
      review_request:
        mode: code
    stages:
      initialize:
        outputs:
          threat_model: threat_model.threat_model
          codegraph: codegraph.codegraph
        nodes:
          threat_model:
            capabilities:
              - memory
          codegraph: {}
      review:
        inputs:
          codegraph: initialize.codegraph
        nodes:
          simple_llm_review:
            capabilities:
              - memory
              - navigation
          reachability:
            capabilities:
              - memory
              - navigation
          finding_dedup: {}
          result:
            formats:
              - sarif
      triage:
        inputs:
          sarif: review.sarif
          codegraph: initialize.codegraph
        nodes:
          triage:
            capabilities:
              - memory
              - navigation
          result:
            formats:
              - sarif

  codegraph:
    source_functions: []
    security_functions: []
  reachability:
    max_path_length: 25
    domain_profiles: []
    domain_hints: []
```

Execution topology describes what runs and how values flow. Deterministic graph
annotations live under `metis_engine.codegraph`; reachability tuning lives under
`metis_engine.reachability`. Model and reasoning settings default to the shared
provider and query configuration. A node may override the model within that
provider with its `model` field. Reachability first covers selected function
source with the language plugin's normal security-review prompt, batching
nearby functions from the same file in source order. The prompt includes
deterministic CodeGraph evidence and syntax-derived direct-callee return
contracts. Findings identify every necessary-condition alternative for the
reported operation. Code rejects a finding only when deterministic evidence
contradicts every alternative; incomplete or ambiguous evidence remains
fail-open.

A same-file review batch is split in source order when its context, including
navigation evidence, exceeds the global input limit or its returned structured
analysis is invalid; provider failures are not subdivided. Reachability findings
are combined with every other Review-node output and deduplicated by `finding_dedup`.
`max_path_length` must be positive; it bounds reported reachability paths.

Capability runtime settings live under `metis_engine.capabilities`. A node's
`capabilities` list is only an access grant; it does not configure the
capability.

Duplicate explicit YAML keys and malformed core settings fail during loading.
Stage/node registrations, ports, formats, and execution fields are validated
during engine construction and graph compilation. Shared `metis_engine` settings
outside `execution` may inherit packaged defaults; an explicit `execution`
mapping replaces the complete graph. See
[README Configuration](../README.md#configuration). YAML merge keys may be
overridden explicitly. Quote YAML names such as `on`, `off`, `yes`, and `no`.

## Stage contracts

### Initialize

- `threat_model` updates threat-model memory and returns its initialization
  status.

- `codegraph` uses language providers such as Tree-sitter to build, validate,
  annotate, and persist the complete project graph at
  `<codebase>/.metis/codegraph.sqlite3`.

- `index` builds the configured repository index when explicitly included in
  the graph. The packaged graph omits it.

- [`compilation_profile`](config/compilation_profile.md) optionally runs before
  `codegraph`. It uses a C/C++ compilation database and the recorded compiler
  preprocessor to install an active-line source view. `codegraph` then builds
  the usual Tree-sitter graph from that view.

Enable index construction by adding it to `initialize`. The example below is
an Initialize fragment; because a project execution section replaces the
packaged graph, keep the desired Review and Triage stages in the complete
configuration.

```yaml
metis_engine:
  execution:
    stages:
      initialize:
        outputs:
          threat_model: threat_model.threat_model
          codegraph: codegraph.codegraph
          index: index.index
        nodes:
          threat_model:
            capabilities:
              - memory
          codegraph: {}
          index:
            capabilities:
              - index
```

Initialize explicitly maps the node outputs it publishes. A graph that replaces
its nodes must list the corresponding stage outputs.

The `capabilities` list is the complete allowlist for a node. Required and
optional capabilities are declared by the node registration. Omitting an
optional capability keeps it unavailable to that node; omitting a required
capability or naming one the node did not declare is a configuration error.

| Node | Required capabilities | Optional capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `threat_model` | `memory` | — |
| `index` | [`index`](capabilities/index.md) | — |
| `simple_llm_review` | — | `index`, `memory`, `navigation` |
| `reachability` | — | `index`, `memory`, `navigation` |
| `triage` | [`navigation`](capabilities/navigation.md) | `memory` |

Nodes without a row do not declare engine capabilities.

### Review

The review request supports `code`, `dir`, `file`, and `patch` modes. When
configured, Review receives the persisted graph reference from Initialize;
it does not build or modify the graph.

`simple_llm_review` is the generic review node. It reviews every file in the
selected scope with the language plugin's prompts and does not require a
CodeGraph.

Both discovery nodes support [navigation](capabilities/navigation.md) when granted;
the packaged graph enables it.

`reachability` resolves the initialized CodeGraph reference and reviews selected
function source with the normal language security-review prompt. The evidence
includes deterministic function, call, control-flow, assignment, loop, return,
and direct-callee contract facts. The model must identify every
necessary-condition alternative for each finding. Deterministic admission may
reject a finding only when every alternative is contradicted by supported
source facts; missing, ambiguous, or incomplete evidence remains fail-open.
Direct-callee contract records with no known return or normal-exit facts are
omitted from the prompt; absent contracts remain unknown, not evidence of safety.

For file, directory, and filtered code reviews, only functions in the selected
files are scheduled for LLM discovery. The surrounding caller/callee graph is
retained for contract derivation, prompt evidence, deterministic checks, and
path annotation; navigation may still inspect supporting files. Coverage counts
refer to the selected review functions, not every function retained as context.
Unrestricted code review continues to schedule all selected project functions.

Same-file functions are batched in source order. Multi-function batches with
invalid or output-limited responses, or input overflow during navigation, are
split immediately and their children are reviewed in the same run. A single
function that still exceeds the input limit remains incomplete. Batch results
and split decisions are not persisted. Language
plugins supply deterministic CodeGraph semantics during initialization.
Directory and file review derive in-memory scopes from the same persisted
project graph; neither mode rebuilds or mutates it.
Patch review is supported by `simple_llm_review`. If `reachability` is selected
for a patch request, it publishes an inconclusive warning rather than silently
running another node. For code, directory, and file review, Reachability sends
files without CodeGraph and semantics support to the simple LLM fallback. When
`simple_llm_review` is explicitly selected alongside `reachability`, it owns
that generic review pass so unsupported files are not reviewed twice.

The CodeGraph service returns an independent in-memory graph to each consumer.
Nodes do not mutate the persisted graph. Model-derived findings remain review
or SARIF data; they are not written back as structural CodeGraph facts.

`finding_dedup` gathers every selected node output that uses the stable
`ReviewRun` contract. It combines those runs, removes exact duplicates, and
resolves semantic duplicates once for the whole review. Its distinct output
contract makes it the only valid input to `result`. Patch results pass through
unchanged.

`result` validates and publishes the finalized review before generating SARIF.
Its `formats` list declares
the representations written for that execution. Every listed format is saved.
Review publishes canonical `findings` for JSON, HTML, and CSV renderers and
always publishes `sarif` in memory for downstream stages. It also republishes
the initialized CodeGraph reference when one is provided.
Omitting `sarif` from `formats` prevents a SARIF file from being written; it
does not remove the in-memory SARIF contract.

The execution graph planner binds an omitted singular node input only when
exactly one selected output is compatible. Collection inputs gather all
compatible outputs in declaration order and require at least one successful
producer; one failed producer does not suppress the consumer. Explicit
bindings resolve singular ambiguities and may select or order collection
sources. Same-named stage inputs, such as the Review request, retain precedence.
Cross-stage values remain explicit under the stage's `inputs` mapping.

Fan-in is declared with a homogeneous `tuple[T, ...]` port, including an
`Annotated` or nullable wrapper. Fixed-length and unparameterized tuples are
single payloads. Values are validated strictly against the declared annotation;
nullable ports do not enable coercion. Omitted nullable inputs become `None` for
both inferred bindings and explicit `$inputs` references. Unsupported annotations
are rejected during compilation. A registration may name inputs in
`required_when_bound` when a selected producer must succeed even though an
unbound input accepts `None`; this requirement follows the port rather than a
built-in node name.

An explicit source written as `node_name` selects that node's only output. Use
`node_name.output_name` when the producer has multiple outputs. Cross-stage
bindings use `stage_name.output_name`. In a stage's `inputs` mapping,
`$inputs.name` selects a top-level execution input. In a node's `inputs`
mapping, it selects an input already bound on that stage.

When a stage omits `outputs`, the complete output contract of its terminal
`result` node becomes the stage contract. Stages without a `result` node, such
as Initialize, may list the same-named single-output nodes they publish. A
stage may instead map public output names to explicit node sources when it
needs a selected output from a multi-output node or a renamed stage output:

```yaml
outputs:
  verdict: verifier.verdict
```

`filename` optionally sets an extensionless output base on a result node:

```yaml
result:
  formats: [sarif, json]
  filename: results/review
```

This writes `results/review.sarif` and `results/review.json`. A stage may configure
one filename, on the node that publishes its `filename` output. An external
replacement can use its own name and an explicit binding such as
`outputs: {filename: private_result.filename}`.

Any explicit `--output-file` path makes the CLI authoritative for that run.
The `.sarif`, `.html`, `.csv`, or `.json` extension selects its format. Each
explicit path is preserved; the first path assigned to a stage supplies the
basename for that stage's requested formats that have no explicit path. If
Review and Triage both request an explicitly named format, its paths apply to
the later Triage result; Review uses a timestamped `graph_review` path to keep
the files distinct. A result node's YAML `filename` is used only when the CLI
does not supply an output path. When neither CLI nor YAML supplies a filename,
a graph run writes
`results/graph_review_<timestamp>_<unique-id>.<format>` and
`results/graph_triage_<timestamp>_<unique-id>.<format>` for the formats requested by each
stage. Supported formats are SARIF, JSON, HTML, and CSV. Conflicting effective
YAML destinations are rejected before writing, including case and Unicode aliases on
filesystems that equate those names. JSON, SARIF, HTML, and CSV replace
the destination atomically after a complete write, preserving the prior file if
rendering or writing fails.

### Review checkpoints and resume

Built-in review producers persist successful work items under the codebase's
private Metis state directory. Review checkpoints are enabled by default in the
packaged `metis.yaml`:

```text
<codebase>/.metis/checkpoints/review.simple_llm_review.sqlite3
<codebase>/.metis/checkpoints/review.reachability.sqlite3
```

Every review of that codebase automatically reuses compatible records,
independent of its output filename. A changed source, prompt, threat-model
context, model setting, Metis version, response schema, or chunk plan produces a
different record key and reruns that work. Simple and reachability reviews with
model tools enabled bypass answer checkpoints: retrieved repository/index
evidence is not covered by a stable packet revision identity. The packaged graph
enables navigation for both nodes, so its discovery calls run afresh. Removing
the navigation grant allows tool-free checkpoint reuse.

Simple review checkpoints contain validated per-file results; patch records also
retain each completed file summary. Reachability checkpoints contain validated
packet responses; deterministic anchoring, admission, authority filtering, and
finding preparation always run again. Failures are not cached. Each successful
work item is atomically upserted by key. `finding_dedup` writes the normal final
output without replacing producer files.

Checkpoint storage is best effort. Unreadable or incompatible databases are
preserved and treated as a cache miss; failed writes are logged. Metis does not
remove or rebuild them automatically, because another process may have repaired
the file after the failure was observed. Malformed individual records are skipped
without hiding other valid records.

Short lowercase ASCII producer identifiers retain readable filenames. Other
identifiers use an exact-name digest so case, Unicode normalization and long
names cannot mix producer state. Ambiguous older filenames are not resumed.

Disable review checkpoint reads and writes globally in the selected YAML:

```yaml
metis_engine:
  review_checkpoints: false
```

### Triage

`metis_engine.triage.include_triaged` controls whether findings already
annotated by Metis are processed again. It defaults to `false` when omitted and
is therefore absent from the packaged YAML. It is Triage configuration, not an
execution-graph input. The `--include-triaged` flag enables it for one run.

`triage` classifies each SARIF finding with navigation evidence. When its
optional CodeGraph input covers the reported file, deterministic function and
call relationships are included in that evidence. The same node handles
unsupported files and standalone triage runs without a CodeGraph. Triage never
materializes a graph itself.

Normal review-to-triage execution does not deduplicate twice: `triage` receives
SARIF generated from the `FinalReviewRun` already produced by `finding_dedup`.

The bindings `sarif: review.sarif` and `codegraph: initialize.codegraph`
transfer those values and make both earlier stages data dependencies. Do not
repeat those relationships in `depends_on`.

Triage has its own `result` node because its SARIF represents a later state.

`depends_on` is reserved for ordering without a value transfer, such as
waiting for initialization to update memory or an index.

A graph may instead triage third-party SARIF:

```yaml
metis_engine:
  execution:
    inputs:
      sarif:
        version: "2.1.0"
        runs:
          - results: []
    stages:
      triage:
        inputs:
          sarif: $inputs.sarif
        nodes:
          triage:
            capabilities:
              - memory
              - navigation
          result:
            formats:
              - sarif
```

The optional CodeGraph input remains unset for third-party SARIF.

## Execution

Metis runs the selected graph whenever `--interactive` is absent. Global options
such as `--verbose`, `--config`, and `--codebase-path` do not change the run
mode. `--interactive` starts the prompt. Interactive commands enter the
corresponding stage contract directly:

| Command | Stage |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | `initialize` |
| `review_code`, `review_dir`, `review_file`, `review_patch` | `review` |
| `triage` | `triage` |

Direct commands use the selected stage's transitive prerequisites in the same
topological order as full graph execution; unrelated stages are skipped. Explicit
inputs supplied to direct triage satisfy its data bindings, while declared control
dependencies still run. Resolved contracts and topology are owned by the engine;
mutating the caller's configuration after construction does not change execution.

An `ERROR` stage stops later stages. Its result retains outputs from earlier
completed stages and non-error same-stage nodes when exposed by configured stage
bindings or the implicit terminal `result` convention; error-result and unbound
internal outputs are discarded. Public execution raises
`metis.engine.ExecutionGraphError`, whose `result` contains those outputs and
structured diagnostics. Values that cannot be serialized to JSON remain native
values in that result.

`concurrent.futures.CancelledError` propagates directly after active stage work
drains and does not expose a partial `ExecutionResult`. An inconclusive stage
retains valid outputs and later stages continue. The non-interactive graph CLI
keeps its zero exit code for inconclusive execution and exits nonzero for an
execution error.

## Built-in implementation layout

Fixed workflow behavior is grouped by Stage. Reusable graph Nodes own a
directory containing their registration, contracts, configuration, and
implementation:

```text
src/metis/engine/
  stages/
    <stage>/
    configuration.py
    service.py
  nodes/
    <node>/
    builtins.py
```

Stages own workflow contracts and orchestration. Nodes own executable behavior
and may be selected, omitted, or supplied by another package. Built-in Nodes
import Stage contracts; Stages do not import Node implementations.

Stages do not enumerate or construct their nodes. The built-in Node composition
module constructs the selected registrations and their services, while
`MetisEngine` owns the engine lifecycle and invokes that module. The lower-level
execution runner remains unaware of built-in Stage behavior. Adding a built-in
Node therefore changes its Node package, the built-in composition module, and
YAML topology; it does not change Stage execution code. Separately distributed
public or private Nodes and Stages require no Metis change and register through
the entry points described below.

Use [Adding built-in execution nodes and stages](contributing/adding-execution-component.md)
for the internal registration, composition, lifecycle-ownership, and test steps.

## Adding external nodes and stages

Packages may add nodes within built-in or external stages without modifying
Metis. Packages may also add new top-level stages.

The `metis.execution_nodes` Python module is the Execution Node API. It exports
registration, invocation, context, result, and Stage value contracts for Node
authors. Its `__all__` list defines those Python exports; it is not a catalog of
Nodes available to the YAML graph. External packages should declare a Metis
dependency range in `pyproject.toml` for the API surface they use.

A Node becomes selectable in YAML only when Metis has a `NodeRegistration` for
its name and Stage. Built-in registrations come from Metis. A separately
distributed package supplies registrations through the stage-qualified
`metis.execution_nodes` Python packaging entry-point group:

### External package template

An external repository can start with this layout and add one registration
module per node:

```text
external_metis_nodes/
  pyproject.toml
  src/
    external_metis_nodes/
      __init__.py
      policy.py
```

The package metadata registers each node independently, so Metis loads only
the nodes selected by YAML:

```toml
[build-system]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
requires = ["setuptools>=82"]

[project]
name = "external-metis-nodes"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = ["metis>=1.5,<2"]

[project.entry-points."metis.execution_nodes"]
"review.private_policy" = "external_metis_nodes.policy:registration"
```

Install that package in the same environment as Metis. Adding another external
node means adding its module, one entry-point line, and its YAML selection; no
Metis source change is required.

For an internal checkout that keeps the open-source Metis tree untouched, let
the external submodule own the uv project:

```text
metis/
  pyproject.toml
  external_modules/
    custom_flow/
      pyproject.toml
      examples/
        metis.yaml
      src/
        external_metis_nodes/
        external_metis_stages/
```

```toml
[project]
name = "external-metis-flow"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = ["metis>=1.5,<2"]

[tool.uv.sources]
metis = { path = "../..", editable = true }
```

The external package owns dependencies, entry points, environment, and
lockfile. The open-source checkout does not change when another package
is added:

Set `EXTERNAL_REPO` to the repository URL or local path, then run:

```bash
git submodule add "$EXTERNAL_REPO" external_modules/custom_flow
uv sync --project external_modules/custom_flow
uv run --project external_modules/custom_flow metis \
  --config external_modules/custom_flow/examples/metis.yaml \
  --codebase-path ../project
```

A checkout alone is not discoverable. Metis finds external nodes and stages
through installed Python entry points, and uv installs the local Metis path
source editably.

### External stages

An external stage declares its input and required output contract through the
`metis.execution_stages` entry-point group. Keep the stage package separate
from Metis; the YAML uses only the registered stage name:

```toml
[project.entry-points."metis.execution_stages"]
verify = "external_metis_stages.verify:registration"
```

```python
from metis.execution_nodes import ReviewResult
from metis.execution_stages import StageContract
from metis.execution_stages import StageRegistration

registration = StageRegistration(
    name="verify",
    contract=StageContract(
        inputs={"review": ReviewResult},
        required_outputs={"verdict": str},
    ),
)
```

The entry point may expose the registration or a zero-argument callable that
returns it. Its name must match `registration.name`; duplicate registrations and
collisions with `initialize`, `review`, or `triage` fail. Only configured
external stages are loaded, except built-in-name collisions are rejected during
catalog construction.

Bind this stage's `review` input to `review.findings` to consume the default
Review stage's published findings. `ReviewRun` is the internal node-to-node
collection contract; `FinalReviewRun` and `JsonPromptRequest` are also available
from `metis.execution_nodes` for separately distributed handlers.
`JsonPromptRequest.max_input_tokens` optionally limits rendered model inputs,
including tool history and retries, using the provider's token counter. It is
separate from the output `max_tokens` limit and defaults to no additional input
guard for existing callers. Provider-specific message/schema framing is not
included in that estimate.
External stages may bind the existing `review_request`, `sarif`, and `codegraph`
graph inputs or another stage's outputs. Adding another `$inputs` field requires
a core `ExecutionInputs` change. External stages execute through
`execute_graph()` or as transitive prerequisites of a built-in direct target;
their custom outputs are programmatic/run-log values unless the integration or
Metis CLI adds explicit export routing.

Put Metis compatibility bounds in `project.dependencies`. `tool.uv.sources`
only selects the local editable source during development.

Nodes in that stage still use the normal stage-qualified node entry point:

```toml
[project.entry-points."metis.execution_nodes"]
"verify.private_verifier" = "external_metis_nodes.verify:registration"
```

### Command-backed analysis and validation

The separate `ExternalStageService` API runs command-backed analysis and
validation. Analysis commands produce SARIF. Validation commands consume SARIF
and produce `metis.external.validation-result/v1` decision JSON; Metis applies
those decisions and writes `validated.sarif`.

SARIF and decision files must contain one UTF-8 JSON object without a BOM,
duplicate keys, or non-finite numbers. Reads are capped at 25 MiB before parsing;
parsed documents are then checked against these default limits:

| Limit | Default |
| --- | ---: |
| Nesting depth | 32 |
| JSON nodes, including mapping keys | 200,000 |
| Mapping keys | 100,000 |
| Bytes per string | 64 KiB |
| Items per array | 10,000 |
| Findings or validation decisions | 10,000 |

The API accepts a `sarif_limits=SarifLimits(...)` argument to configure these
bounds. They apply to analysis reports, validation input, decision JSON, and
the final annotated report. The final report is checked before publication and
written atomically as compact UTF-8 JSON, within the same file-size limit.

Metis requires each finding's primary location to provide a physical file URI
and an integer `startLine` from 1 through 2,147,483,647. Supplementary locations
may instead use logical locations, artifact references, or address/offset
information; context regions may use character or byte offsets. Absolute file
URIs remain supported. Compared with the earlier command API, numeric strings
and booleans for line numbers, malformed known fields, and oversized reports
are now rejected. These checks do not constitute full SARIF schema validation
and do not replace the typed contracts for installed execution-graph stages.

### External analysis with a bundled implementation

A Review node may package a deterministic analyzer, library, or executable in
the same external distribution. This node-internal implementation is not a Tool
in the execution-graph terminology and does not need a Metis capability
registration. The node converts its output to the stable `ReviewRun` contract
so `finding_dedup` can combine it with other analyses before `result` generates
SARIF.

For example, an independently registered `new_analysis` node can run alongside
Reachability. This is a Review-stage fragment; retain the other desired stages
and execution inputs in the complete graph:

```yaml
metis_engine:
  execution:
    stages:
      initialize:
        outputs:
          codegraph: codegraph.codegraph
        nodes:
          codegraph: {}
      review:
        inputs:
          codegraph: initialize.codegraph
        nodes:
          reachability: {}
          new_analysis: {}
          finding_dedup: {}
          result:
            formats:
              - sarif
```

The execution graph planner infers the CodeGraph input, gathers every compatible
Review output for `finding_dedup`, and routes its finalized output to `result`.

Its entry point and essential ports are:

```toml
[project.entry-points."metis.execution_nodes"]
"review.new_analysis" = "external_metis_nodes.new_analysis:registration"
```

```python
registration = NodeRegistration(
    name="new_analysis",
    stage="review",
    configuration=NewAnalysisConfiguration,
    inputs={"request": ReviewCommand},
    outputs={"review": ReviewRun},
    execute=execute,
)
```

The runner supplies the Review request because the input uses the canonical
`request` name and type. To replace Reachability, omit `reachability`; the
deduplication node then gathers only `new_analysis`. To consume an existing
CodeGraph, declare a `CodeGraphReference` input. The planner can infer its
unique producer, or YAML can bind it explicitly.

Engine capabilities such as `memory`, `index`, and `navigation` are declared by
the node and granted through YAML. Separately distributed shared capabilities
use the `metis.capabilities` entry-point group described in
[Adding a Metis Capability](capabilities/adding-capability.md). Metis discovers
entry-point names at startup but imports and constructs a shared capability only
after a selected node has declared and been granted it. Direct commands may
request their own built-in capability. Model-tool adapters remain explicit node
behavior; granting a capability does not automatically expose its operations to
a model.

### Registration template

The entry-point name is always `<stage>.<node>`. Its target returns the
registration used by the bare node name in YAML. In this example,
`src/external_metis_nodes/policy.py` contains:

```python
from typing import cast

from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic import ConfigDict

from metis.execution_nodes import CapabilityRequirement
from metis.execution_nodes import NodeInvocation
from metis.execution_nodes import NodeRegistration
from metis.execution_nodes import NodeResult
from metis.execution_nodes import ReviewRun


class PolicyConfiguration(BaseModel):
    policy: str

    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid", frozen=True)


def execute(invocation: NodeInvocation) -> NodeResult:
    configuration = cast(PolicyConfiguration, invocation.configuration)
    review = cast(ReviewRun, invocation.inputs["review"])
    # Apply the private policy and return the same canonical review contract.
    return NodeResult({"review": review})


registration = NodeRegistration(
    name="private_policy",
    stage="review",
    configuration=PolicyConfiguration,
    inputs={"review": ReviewRun},
    outputs={"review": ReviewRun},
    execute=execute,
    capabilities={
        "memory": CapabilityRequirement.OPTIONAL,
    },
)
```

The registration declares its stable name, owning stage, Pydantic
configuration model, typed input and output ports, capability requirements,
and handler. The node key in YAML selects that registration; YAML never
contains its Python import path.
Extension packages import these contracts from `metis.execution_nodes`; they
do not import the execution service or capability implementations.
Only selected entry points are loaded. Missing registrations, duplicate names,
wrong-stage registrations, invalid configuration, and incompatible port
connections fail before execution.

Node-specific tuning is separate from topology. This fragment shows only the
Review stage:

```yaml
metis_engine:
  execution:
    stages:
      review:
        nodes:
          simple_llm_review:
            model: gpt-5-mini
            capabilities:
              - index
              - memory
          private_policy:
            max_concurrency: 50
            inputs:
              review: simple_llm_review
          finding_dedup:
            inputs:
              reviews:
                - private_policy
          result:
            formats: [sarif, json]
            filename: results/review
    node_configuration:
      review:
        private_policy:
          policy: strict
```

Omitting `model` uses `query.model`, then `llm_provider.model`. A model override
uses the configured provider and credentials; it does not select another
provider. For Azure OpenAI, the override names the model deployment.

A handler receives validated inputs and a small context containing its granted
capabilities together with the repository lookup contract, CodeGraph
materialize/load API, model runner, runtime limits, shared job scheduler, and
callbacks. Dependency-ready nodes run concurrently. For example,
`threat_model` and `codegraph` run together in Initialize. After its barrier,
`simple_llm_review` and `reachability` may run together over the initialized
graph.

The engine has three independent concurrency limits:

| Setting under `metis_engine` | Scope | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_workers` | Active jobs across all nodes and graph executions on one engine | `5` |
| `max_active_nodes` | Active node handlers across all stages and graph executions on one engine | Inherits `max_workers` |
| `max_concurrent_executions` | Admitted graph executions, including direct stage entry points | Inherits `max_workers` |

All limits accept positive integers; `null` for either new setting means inherit
`max_workers`. For example:

```yaml
metis_engine:
  max_workers: 8
  max_active_nodes: 3
  max_concurrent_executions: 2
```

This engine admits two executions, runs at most three node handlers, and runs at
most eight jobs. Further execution callers wait for admission without creating
another pool. They wake with a closed-service error if the engine closes while
waiting. A handler, job or callback must not synchronously execute another graph
on the same engine: reentry is rejected before waiting, even when capacity is
available. An unrelated engine has its own limits.

The node pool and job pool are separate and owned by the execution service.
This allows a node to wait for its jobs even with a single worker in either pool.
Caller threads, provider background threads and direct capability calls are not
counted as job workers. These settings are not a provider-wide request limit:
a direct prompt call occupies its node handler, while a call inside `jobs.run`
occupies a job worker. Nodes use `invocation.context.jobs.run(...)` instead of
creating executors or leaving background work after returning.

`max_concurrency` limits a node's active jobs; omitted values use
`metis_engine.max_workers`. Concurrent submissions through the same node handle
share its limit. All nodes share the engine's job pool; newly active job runs
receive available workers before busier runs are replenished. A pool job must
not synchronously submit another run to the same scheduler; this raises
`RuntimeError`. Slow completion callbacks retain backpressure for their own job
run without blocking other eligible runs. Node submission and graph admission
do not promise FIFO ordering.

Cancellation is cooperative. Each execution owns a root signal, and the runtime
creates child scopes for its stages and nodes. A child inherits cancellation from
its ancestors; cancelling it never sets an ancestor or sibling signal.
`jobs.with_cancellation(event)` binds a child handle to that Event, and `cancel()`
sets the bound Event, cancels queued jobs and signals active jobs. Custom
`NodeJobs` implementations must honor the same contract. `runtime.is_cancelled()`
and the job handle observe the same child signal. Context variables carry logging
and execution identity into workers; they do not own cancellation.

Handlers check `runtime.is_cancelled()` in long loops, or use
`context.report_progress(...)`, which checks even without a progress callback.
Returning a successful result after cancelling the node is rejected as
cancellation. Ordinary job failures become node errors and cancel that node's
cooperative job peers; independent nodes may continue.
`concurrent.futures.CancelledError` from a handler aborts its stage and
propagates to the caller. A stage drains its own active handlers before
returning, including on failure, and leaves other executions' shared-pool work
intact.

Closing an engine rejects new work, wakes waiting callers, signals admitted
executions, drains handlers and jobs, then closes capabilities. Close from an
active handler, job or callback is rejected. Threads and in-flight I/O cannot be
preempted: extensions must use finite network/subprocess timeouts and join any
work they start before returning. A non-cooperative call delays shutdown until
it returns or its timeout expires. Concurrent close callers all wait for execution
draining. Capability cleanup runs once; a repeated close may return while that
cleanup is running, so cleanup callbacks can reenter close. Interruptions during
draining are re-raised after cleanup completes.
Direct capability callers are outside graph tracking and must coordinate their
own lifetime with shutdown.

A node accesses only the names in `invocation.context.capabilities`. A node declares
`request: ReviewCommand` when it needs the review-stage request; the runner
supplies that typed stage input without extra YAML. The context does not expose
internal engine services or `EngineConfig`. Installed node code runs in the
Metis process; private distribution does not imply sandboxing.

The runner passes typed values between nodes using explicit bindings or the
inferred typed contracts described above. Each invocation receives a fresh
configuration model validated from a private snapshot of the original node
settings; shared port values are borrowed and should be treated as read-only
by handlers. Copy a mutable port value before modifying it, and keep per-run
state local to the handler or in objects created for that invocation rather than
in a registration, global variable or shared capability. Capability objects are
shared across node handlers, jobs and admitted executions. Their implementations
must synchronize mutable state or confine non-thread-safe clients to a serialized
operation. Factory/cleanup synchronization does not serialize capability method
calls; keep locks inside the capability's state boundary and release them before
invoking external callbacks.

Progress delivery is serialized within one execution. Other callbacks (debug,
checkpoint, resume and diagnostic), and callbacks reused across executions, may
run concurrently. They must protect shared state. Callbacks run inline and must
not wait on another handler or callback that needs their lock or worker capacity.
Execution callbacks should propagate deliberate
`concurrent.futures.CancelledError`; ordinary callback failure behavior belongs
to each call site. Nodes do not receive or invoke other executable nodes:
keeping execution in the runner preserves dependency validation, ordering,
diagnostics, and replacement by another registration such as
`reachability_v2`.

Registrations are scoped by stage, so Review and Triage may both define a
`result` node. Built-in names cannot be silently replaced. A private
replacement uses its own name and the selected YAML routes the terminal value
to it. A node that is omitted from YAML is neither loaded nor executed.

Progress callbacks receive lifecycle events for stage and node starts
and ends, dependency-skipped nodes, final status, and elapsed duration.
Non-cancellation node exceptions and invalid results or outputs become `ERROR`
with an `execution.node_failed` diagnostic. An explicit `ERROR` result retains
only its handler diagnostics. Nodes with failed required data or control
dependencies are reported as skipped while independent nodes continue;
`concurrent.futures.CancelledError` propagates as described above. Long-running
node loops emit through `invocation.context.report_progress(...)` so cancellation
is checked even when the CLI is not rendering progress.

## CodeGraph provider contract

CodeGraph references identify immutable stored revisions. Retrying an incomplete
graph or building the same fingerprint from another service does not invalidate
an issued reference. Fingerprint lookup prefers the latest valid complete revision
and otherwise returns the latest valid incomplete revision. Existing v2 stores
migrate their fingerprint constraint transactionally while preserving revisions
and record rows. Revisions are retained without automatic pruning.

Adding language support does not change the execution graph. An external
language package that declares `codegraph: true` must:

1. Implement `CodeGraphProvider.build_graph()`.
2. Return `CodeGraphResult` whose disjoint `processed_files` and `failed_files`
   cover the exact requested file set. Error diagnostics must cover exactly
   the failed files, allowing valid partial results to remain usable.
3. Expose its factory through the `metis.codegraph_providers` entry-point
   group.
4. Name the entry point after the language manifest.
5. Declare `codegraph: true` in the language manifest.
6. Register a same-named CodeGraph semantics implementation when the language
   supports advanced review.

Built-in CodeGraph languages instead compose their provider in `MetisEngine`
under the manifest's language name. Add same-named deterministic semantics only
for Reachability support; see
[Language plugins](language-plugins.md#add-a-built-in-language).

Providers receive the repository root, their exact files, a progress callback,
and `CodeGraphProviderContext` language/file-role lookups plus optional
`source_for_path(path)`. When that callback returns bytes, including `b""`, parse
those profiled bytes; read the filesystem only when it is absent or returns
`None`.
They must use globally unique symbol IDs, resolve their internal calls, and
return nodes only for requested files. Metis validates each provider result and
the composed graph.

The stable `metis.execution_nodes` facade does not yet export every CodeGraph
record model needed to construct a populated graph. External implementations
that import those models from `metis.engine.codegraph` are version-coupled and
must pin and test their supported Metis range.

C and C++ are internally routed through one shared build so calls across the
language boundary can be resolved. Their built-in implementation uses
tree-sitter. Tree-sitter is a C-family implementation dependency, not a
requirement of reachability or `CodeGraph`. A Python provider may use Python
ASTs, a type checker, or another implementation as long as it returns the same
contract.

Provider construction is lazy and failures are isolated at that boundary.
Unsupported files receive generic review from an explicitly selected
`simple_llm_review` node, or from Reachability's internal fallback when it is the
only review producer; missing support itself is only debug-logged.

## CodeGraph semantics contract

A language with advanced review support declares the CodeGraph support flag in
its language manifest:

```yaml
capabilities:
  codegraph: true
```

An external package registers semantics independently of its CodeGraph builder.
The entry-point name must match the language manifest name:

```toml
[project.entry-points."metis.codegraph_semantics"]
python = "external_metis_python.semantics:PythonSemantics"
```

The provider consumes immutable per-node facts and returns validated
annotations. It cannot mutate the shared CodeGraph:

```python
from metis.codegraph_semantics import CodeGraphAnnotations
from metis.codegraph_semantics import CodeGraphNodeFacts


class PythonSemantics:
    def analyze_node(
        self,
        facts: CodeGraphNodeFacts,
    ) -> CodeGraphAnnotations:
        if "eval" in facts.unresolved_calls:
            return CodeGraphAnnotations(
                is_sink=True,
                sink_type="code_injection",
                sink_reason="calls Python eval",
            )
        return CodeGraphAnnotations()
```

Semantics providers may also attach open-ended `Tag` values to a node under
namespaced keys. Tags are persisted with the canonical CodeGraph and passed
through unchanged to consuming nodes:

```python
from metis.codegraph_semantics import CodeGraphAnnotations
from metis.codegraph_semantics import Tag


class PythonSemantics:
    def analyze_node(self, facts):
        return CodeGraphAnnotations(
            tags={
                "trust.domain": Tag(value="user", reason="handles request body"),
            },
        )
```

Metis resolves semantics providers lazily and serializes calls to each provider
instance; implementations do not need to be thread-safe. Their deterministic
annotations are persisted in the canonical CodeGraph. A language without
configured semantics does not use Reachability; generic-review ownership follows
the fallback rule above.
